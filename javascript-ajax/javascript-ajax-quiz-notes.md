## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is AJAX? AJAX stands for Asynchronous JavaScript and XML, a web development technique in which a web app fetches content from the server by making asynchronous HTTP requests

- What does the AJAX acronym stand for? Asynchronous JavaScript and XML.

- Which object is built into the browser for making HTTP requests in JavaScript? XMLHttpRequest

- What event is fired by `XMLHttpRequest` objects when they are finished loading the data from the server? readystatechange event

- **Bonus Question**: An `XMLHttpRequest` object has an `addEventListener()` method just like DOM elements. How is it possible that they both share this functionality? XMLHttpRequest objects, like DOM elements, are part of the broader JavaScript environment and are designed to support event-driven programming. The addEventListener() method allows you to attach event handlers to XMLHttpRequest objects, similar to how it is used with DOM elements. This consistency in the API design makes it easier for developers to work with different aspects of JavaScript, promoting a unified and familiar programming model.
