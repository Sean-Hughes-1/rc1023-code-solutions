## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is the purpose of a loop? It allows you to execute a block of code repeatedly and to do so a set number of times

- What is the purpose of a **condition** expression in a loop? determines whether the loop should continue

- What does "iteration" mean in the context of loops? iteration is the process of repeatedly executing a block of code until a certain condition is met.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `while` loop get evaluated? the condition expression is evaluated before each iteration. If the condition is true, the loop continues. If the condition is false, the loop terminates.

- _When_ does the **initialization** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated? , the initialization expression is evaluated once, before the loop starts.

- _When_ does the **condition** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated? before each iteration.

- _When_ does the **final** expression of a `for` loop get evaluated? at the end of each iteration.

- Besides a `return` statement, which exits its entire function block, which keyword exits a loop before its **condition** expression evaluates to `false`? break

- What does the `++` increment operator do? it adds one to the value of a variable

- How do you iterate through the keys of an object? using a for in loop
