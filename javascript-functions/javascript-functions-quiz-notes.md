## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a function in JavaScript? It is a block of code that can be reused in a program

- Describe the parts of a function **definition**. function keyword, parethesis with variables, code block

- Describe the parts of a function **call**. function name, Parenthesis with arguments, if any.

- When comparing them side-by-side, what are the differences between a function **call** and a function **definition**? definition contains the block of code to execute and the parameter where the call is just calling that function by name and passing any arguments if any.

- What is the difference between a **parameter** and an **argument**? a parameter is like a variable, it is a space where information can be passed into the function. an argument is when data is passed into the function from the function call

- Why are function **parameters** useful? they allow a function to be dynamic

- What two effects does a `return` statement have on the behavior of a function? it returns a value and prevents any more code from being executed
