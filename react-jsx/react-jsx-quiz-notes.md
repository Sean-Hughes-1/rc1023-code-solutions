## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is JSX?
  SX stands for JavaScript XML. It is a syntax extension for JavaScript recommended by React for describing what the UI should look like.

- How does React use JSX to render components?
  JSX allows developers to write HTML elements and components in a syntax that looks similar to XML or HTML. It is not a separate template language; instead, it gets transpiled into JavaScript.

When React encounters JSX, it translates it into a corresponding JavaScript representation using React.createElement(). This creates a virtual DOM representation of the UI, which is then efficiently updated and rendered on the actual DOM
