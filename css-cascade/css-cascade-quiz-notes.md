## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What are the four components of "the Cascade". Specificity, Source Order, Inheritance

- What does the term "source order" mean with respect to CSS? The order in which styles are applied to elements on a page with styles defined later
  in the style sheet taking precedence over earlier styles

- How is it possible for the styles of an element to be applied to its children as well without an additional CSS rule? by inheritence, the styles applied to a parent element, by default, will apply to the children

- List the three selector types in order of increasing specificity. type selectors, class selectors, id selectors

- Why is using `!important` considered bad practice? It can make the code harder to maintain. It overrides cascade and specificity that can cause crazy things to happen unexpectedly
