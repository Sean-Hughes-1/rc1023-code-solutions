## Quiz Questions

After completing this exercise, you should be able to discuss or answer the following questions:

- What is a React component?
  It is a re-usable piece of UI. Usually in the form of a function that returns the JSX and logic for the component.

- How do you define a component in React?
  You can either define as a class or a function

- How is a component "rendered" (made visible on the browser page)?
  In a functional component, the rendering is done within the function's return statement. In a class component, the render method returns the JSX that represents the component's UI. The rendered content is then converted into a virtual DOM representation and efficiently updated on the actual DOM.
