How do you declare a variable? using var, const or let
How do you initialize (assign a value to) a variable? use the assignment operator '='
What characters are allowed in variable names? letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, underscores, and the dollar sign. Variable names must start with a letter, underscore, or dollar sign, and they are case-sensitive.
